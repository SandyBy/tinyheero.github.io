Being a somewhat structured person, it's important for me to see how topics relate to each other. With machine learning and statistics being such expansive topics, I struggled (and still do) to understand how all the different methods related to each other. This page is my attempt to structure the various topics/methods of machine learning and statistics. My ultimate goal will be to have a post on each of these topics.

> This page is very much a work-in-progress

## Statistics

1. Probabilities
	* Probability Distribution
	* Joint Probability
	* Marginal Probability
	* Conditional Probability
1. Probabiity Distributions
  * Continuous
    + Gaussian (Normal) Distribution
  * Discrete
    + Binomial Distribution
      * Bernoulli Distribution (n = 1)
1. Bayesian Statistics
	* Classical Frequentist vs. Bayesian 
	* Bayes' Rule

## Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
    * Regression
        + Linear Regression
    * Classification
        + Logistic Regression
        + Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
        + Support Vector Machines (SVM)
1. Unsupervised Learning
    * Cluster Analysis
        + [Mixture Models]({% post_url 2015-10-13-mixture-model %})
