In some of the posts I've written in my blog, I've first written them in rmarkdown and then converted them into a markdown file to be subsequently processed by jekyll. Nicole White made a [fantastic post on how to publish an rmarkdown file for a jekyll blog](http://nicolewhite.github.io/2015/02/07/r-blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll.html) and this is what helped me at first. 

One aspect that isn't mentioned is how rmarkdown equations (rendered with Mathjax) don't transfer very nicely to markdown.
