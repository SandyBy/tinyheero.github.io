Probability distributions is a way to represent all possible outcomes and their respective mutually exclusive probabilities. These probabilities need to satisfy 3 properties:

1. Value has to be non-negative (can't have negative probability).
1. Sum of probabilites across all possible outcomes must equal 1.
1. For two mutually exclusive events, the probability of one or the other is the sum of their individual properties.
