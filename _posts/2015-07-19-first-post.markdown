Welcome to the first post in my newly created blog! Looking forward to blogging about my adventures in bioinformatics, cancer, and big data research. The creation of this blog was done by using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which provides a nice and easy way to get started with a static website that is blog-aware. All the content for this website is hosted on [github](https://github.com/tinyheero/tinyheero.github.io).

I followed the instructions posted kindly by [James Huang on his blog](http://growthalytics.com/programming/2015/07/19/setting-up-your-own-blog/).

The comments are through [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). I followed the [instructions here to do this](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/2014/06/29/adding-disqus-to-your-jekyll-powered-github-pages/).
